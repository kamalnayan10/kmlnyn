      <h1>Hi, I'm Kamalnayan Pathak</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a developer who enjoys working across the stack — from kernel-level
        Rust projects to training generative models with PyTorch. My interests
        lie at the intersection of AI and system design — I find joy in both
        low-level performance tuning and high-level model behavior.
      </p>
      <p className="hide">
        I'm currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science with a specialization
        in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Jagran Lakecity
        University, Bhopal. Alongside that, I'm also enrolled in the BS in Data
        Science program offered by IIT Madras, which helps me strengthen the
        theoretical and mathematical foundations that complement my practical
        work in systems and AI.
